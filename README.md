# DSA-JS 🧑🏻‍💻📈
My journey of learning and practicing data structures and algorithms in JavaScript.

This project reflects my continuous focus on improving **Data Structures and Algorithms** (DSA) skills — applying concepts like:

- Efficient data handling using arrays, maps, and sets  
- Optimized rendering and state management logic  
- Algorithmic patterns (searching, sorting, recursion) to improve app performance

I regularly solve DSA problems to write more **optimized, scalable, and performant** frontend code.
